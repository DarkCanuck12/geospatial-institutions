#Geospatial Institutions
A compilation of geospatial colleges and universities in North America with a focus on Canada and the United States. 

Other colleges and universities outside of North America are welcome, too! The ultimate goal of this project is to include **_all_** geospatial programs available to students around the globe!<br /><br />

##About the Project
This list <a href="http://www.urisa.org/careers/colleges-and-universities" target="_blank">originated</a> as part of the URISA Vanguard Outreach Committee and we hope to reach out to a larger community to provide a list that will serve throughout the geospatial community! :-P

*__Pull requests welcome!__ We would like to keep this list updated with the latest information. If a new geospatial program has started, a contact has changed, or any other addition/change, please submit a pull request! New to Github? No worries, check out the guide below or <a href="http://www.twitter.com/urisavc" target="_blank">contact us</a> to get started. :-)*

###How to: Add/Edit an Institution

1. **<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo" target="_blank">Fork</a> this project to your Guthub account**: If you don't have a Github account, definitely <a href="https://github.com/join" target="_blank">get one</a>. We promise you won't regret it! Once you get one, or if you're already set up, fork this project. :-)
2. **Update the README.md file, if needed**
	- Retain the same overall structure seen in the file (*feel free to copy/paste and edit, where needed*). If you are unsure on how to do so, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/urisavc" target="_blank">contact us</a>. :-)
	- Add in the location, listed in alphabetical order (ie: *US-Alabama*), if needed.
	- If you know of any resources to the location under the header, please add them in for future reference (check out *US-Minnesota* for an example).
	- Add the institution, listed in alphabetical order underneath the location title.
2. **Add/edit the institution in the institutions.geojson file**: Add in the *name of the institution* and the *latitude and longitude*. We recommend **<a href="http://itouchmap.com/latlong.html" target="_blank">this awesome site</a>** for getting the latitude/longitude and going **_four_** decimal points deep and try and add in as much supporting information as you can/know.
3. **Verify your edits**: Ensure the edits you made are accurate, both of the data you are entering and free of any typos. This makes things *much* easier down the road.
4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Need help? Here's a <a href="https://github.com/blog/1969-create-pull-requests-in-github-for-windows" target="_blank">Windows guide</a> on how to submit a request.
5. **Pat yourself on the back for being all-around awesome :-P**
